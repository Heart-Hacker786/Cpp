In this problem, matrix operations are required.
There can be matrix of any size. You have to read rows and columns.
Next read matrix elements accordingly. Next read a positive number,
representing number of operations. There may be any number of operations
possible, however there are 7 different possible operations, which may be
called in any order:

1 multiply kth row with some scalar value
2 multiply kth col with some scalar value
3 add jth row into kth row
4 add jth col into kth col
5 subtract jth row from kth row
6 subtract jth col from kth col
7 show matrix elements in proper format

After reading number of operations. User has to read required
operation number. For each operation further read operation may
be required according to the operation. User has to perform operation
 according to operation number. See input. There are two rows three
 columns. Next there are 6 elements. There are 5 operations. There are
 three show operations represented by 7. Whereas two other operations.
 See output for further understanding.
